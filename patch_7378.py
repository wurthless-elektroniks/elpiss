'''
(Zeropaired) patch for Elpis CB_B 7378

CB_B 9188 fails on Elpis systems with Samsung RAMs, the CPU will crash and reboot during hwinit
even if the glitch attack succeeds. The reason: CB_B simply doesn't support it.

The Elpis CB_B 7378 loader also can't be used in a glitch attack as is because it
expects a different CD than the one normally used for glitching. Also, the Glitch2
9188 loads the CD as plaintext, while 7378 has to decrypt it first. There are other
code differences here and there, but one of the more important ones is that POST codes
don't get output (typical retail CB_B behavior), which throws off glitch attempts and
provides no useful information.

This file patches 7378 so that it can load the normal unsigned CD,
and also adds POST codes back.
